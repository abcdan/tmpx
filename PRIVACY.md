# Privacy Policy for tmpx.email
We want to be transparent and that's why we host our privacy policy on GitHub so everyone can see what changes we make to our service. This
privacy policy _only_ applies to the official tmpx.email instance that's hosted at `https://tmpx.email` by LNGZL.

## How long are the mails stored.
~~Currently, mails are stored for up to 24 hours. This is so you have _enough_ time to do whatever you want with the mails. Of course, you'll be
able to delete them manually in the future.~~
Currently, mails are stored ♾️ forever but this will change soon. Since we're still _heavily_ in development we sometimes need old mails. Expect this to change in the REALLY near future.

## Do you keeps logs? Or do you track certain things?
Yes, we do keep some logs but they are anonymized. This means that _outside of the mail system that stores the mails temporarly_ no mails
are stored at our end.

* We use Cloudflare for protection and analytics
* We host the backend on Digital Ocean
* We host the front-end on Cloudflare

## Where's the data located?
We use the generous Cloudflare Pages system for our front-end and we host our backend over at Digital Ocean in The Netherlands. The IMAP server
is also stored inside The Netherlands.
