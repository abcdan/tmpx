# tmpx ðŸ“¨
A stupidly simple to use temporary mail host. _Yes, there are hundreds of these. It's just fun to learn new things_

## Core features
- A simple web UI where you can generate a temp mail.
- An easy to use Websocket/HTTP API so you can integrate it into your own stuff.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Setup a backend that can stream imap to the right places
- [ ] An endpoint that will fetch recent mail from the IMAP server
- [ ] A CRON that will clear the main inbox after a certain amount of time
- [ ] Download to PDF
- [ ] Forward mail to your own places, like a proxy
- [ ] Connect your own domain, you'll probably have to set something up that it arrives at our inbox.
